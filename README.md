#The Concert Management and Booking Site
This website offers concert bookers, existing fans, and potential fans of The Indian Pop Start like THE ARJIT SINGH a way to see and hear songs from the Indian Idols.

Design
The Bootstrap framework serves as the base for the design of the site. The website uses a single-page layout consisting of seven main sections: the navbar/jumbotron section, band section, gigs section, booking form/modal section, music section, video section, and the social footer section. This layout uses the Bootstrap grid system and each section was built using a wrapper-container-row-column structure. The background of the navbar/jumbotron section makes use of Flexbox to display its background image.

The website is structured semantically with a mobile-first philosophy. Keeping with this approach, the core elements (minimal viable product) of the site are present on all screens while there is more detail present in various areas like the navbar and gigs table on larger screens.
